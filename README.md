# Leveraging Unseen Features along with their PLM-based Representation to Handle Negative Covariate Shift Problem in Text Classification (UFB-L)
This repository contains the source code of the article Leveraging Unseen Features along with their PLM-based Representation to Handle Negative Covariate Shift Problem in Text Classification. It also contains the implementation details and source code of the baseline approaches used in the paper, i.e., Support Vector Machine(SVM), One-Class Support Vector Machine (O-SVM), Embedding-based Support Vector Machine (E-SVM), and Center-Based Similarity Space Learning (CBS-L).
Moreover, it also contains the pre-processed version of the Amazon multi-domain dataset used for the experiments in the paper.
