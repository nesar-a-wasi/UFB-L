# Leveraging Unseen Features along with their PLM-based Representation to Handle Negative Covariate Shift Problem in Text Classification (UFB-L)
This repository contains the source code of the article Leveraging Unseen Features along with their PLM-based Representation to Handle Negative Covariate Shift Problem in Text Classification. It also contain the implementaion details and source code of the baseline approaches used in the paper, i.e., Support Vector Machine(SVM), One-Class Support Vector Machine (O-SVM), Embedding-based Support Vector Machine (E-SVM), and Center-Based Similarity Space Learning (CBS-L).
